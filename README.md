# Digital-Camera-Autodetect-Day-or-Night

Construct a feature in a Digital Camera, which will auto-detect and suggest to the photographer whether the picture should be clicked in day or night mode, depending on whether the picture is being clicked in the daytime or at night. You only need to implement this feature for cases which are directly distinguishable to the eyes (and not fuzzy scenarios such as dawn, dusk, sunrise, sunset, overcast skies which might require more complex aperture adjustments on the camera).
